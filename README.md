## What the Project Does
This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase various projects completed during my analytics journey. It contains a collection of code, analyses, and visualizations developed using both R and Python. The projects cover a range of topics, methodologies, and data types, reflecting my growth and skills in data science and analytics.

## Why the Project is Useful
This project is a centralized resource to demonstrate my practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. It allows potential collaborators, employers, and peers to review my work, understand my technical capabilities, and see my approach to solving analytical problems.

## How to Get Started
To explore the projects in this repository, you can navigate through the following directories:

* **`Python/`**: This folder contains all projects developed using Python, including Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models.
* **`R/`**: This folder contains all projects developed using R, including R scripts and R Markdown files for statistical analysis and data visualization.

You will need to have the necessary software and dependencies installed to run the code in these projects. Each project's directory may contain its own `README.md` or `requirements.txt` file detailing specific dependencies.
